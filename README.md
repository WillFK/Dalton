# Dalton

I made this app so I could easily toggle the grayscale mode.

Also has a floating widget (like Facebook's chat head) for easy access to the feature.

## Install

This app needs special rights to access the configurations of the device.

You'll have to install the app and run:

```
adb shell pm grant fk.home.dalton android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
```

## Credits

those were very helpfull when developing the app.
